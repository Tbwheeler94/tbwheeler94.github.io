My childhood\nnear the ocean in San Diego, CA helped me cultivate a relationship with\nthe natural world from a young age and a course in environmental science\nmy senior year of high school catalyzed my interested in rethinking\nhumanity’s relationship to our planet. As an undergraduate at Santa\nClara University studying environmental science I began thinking more\ncritically about what that new world could look like as a Global Social\nBenefit Fellow through the Miller Center for Social\nEntrepreneurship. My experience helped me better understand business\nstrategy in a developing world context and the potential for business to\nreduce poverty with the right incentives and model. I was also exposed\nto impact investing and the critical role socially responsible investing\ncan play in catalyzing equitable and environmentally sustainable\nbusinesses.\nIn 2016, I spent 4.5 months hiking the 2650 mile Pacific Crest Trail\nfrom Mexico to Canada and had the privilege of discovering many of the\nwestern United State’s most treasured natural spaces. Inspired by my\nwork as an undergraduate I continued developing my interest in social\nenterprise as Business Development for CocoAsenso, a social enterprise\nimproving farmer livelihoods in the rural Philippines through\ndecentralized coconut processing. My experience in the Philippines\nrevealed the tremendous opportunity to improve livelihoods of rural\ncommunities by investing in high-value equipment to improve the value of\ntraditionally low value commodity crops. Following my interest in\ngrowing impact-driven business models working with rural communities, I\nreturned to to San Diego, CA to work with All Across Africa as a Sales\nAssociate. As a Sales Associate, I connected East African women artisans\nwith U.S. retailers including Williams-Sonoma, Wayfair, and The Little\nMarket, creating a high-value market for their handwoven goods and\nimproving their incomes 3-4x from typical agricultural wages.\nToday, I’m interested in using my business experience and education\nin data science tools from UCSD Extension’s Data Science and\nVisualization Bootcamp to guide future investments in aquaculture and\nrenewable energy contexts. At the Bren School for Environmental Science\nand Management, I’m furthering my understanding of human:ecological\nsystems and developing my data science toolkit in R. I’m currently a\ngraduate researcher studying energy use and carbon emissions from data\ncenters with professor Eric Masanet at the Industrial Sustainability\nAnalysis Lab here at UCSB.\n\n\n\n",
