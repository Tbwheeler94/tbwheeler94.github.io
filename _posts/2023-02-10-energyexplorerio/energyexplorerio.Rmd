### Project overview

[energyexplorer.io](https://energy-explorer.herokuapp.com/site-finder/) is an independent project I developed as a master's student at the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/). The main goal of the application to provide an intuitive, user-interactive dashboard for renewable energy developers to estimate the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and net present value (NPV) of a proposed project at a desired location in California.

The mathematical modeling and datasets used on the app's backend were chosen with the guidance of [Dr. Ranjit Deshmukh](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/ranjit-deshmukh).

### Data

[National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/)
- Database of hourly and half-hourly solar radiation (global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance) across the United States and in some international locations. This dataset is accessed using NREL's [Python API](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/python-examples/).

[NREL’s System Advisor Model (SAM)](https://sam.nrel.gov/)
- SAM is a model used to calculate energy generation and financial projections for a variety of renewable energy systems. [energyexplorer.io](https://energy-explorer.herokuapp.com/site-finder/) uses SAM's energy generation model to convert solar radiation data from NSRDB to energy generation by a solar plant with user defined parameters. This tool is accessed using the [NREL-PySAM package](https://pypi.org/project/NREL-PySAM/).

[CAISO OAIS](http://oasis.caiso.com/mrioasis/logon.do)
- Database of real-time and historical data related to the ISO transmission system and its Market, such as system demand forecasts, transmission outage and capacity status, market prices and market result data. Click [here](http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/prices.html) to view a realtime map of wholesale energy prices across California. The current version of [energyexplorer.io](https://energy-explorer.herokuapp.com/site-finder/) uses a static, one year hourly dataset from the HOLLISTR_1_N101 for all future price predictions. This dataset was manually extracted using the CAISO OASIS online downloader.

[U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks: Q1 2021](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/80694.pdf)
- This NREL report was used to define capex and fixed o&m parameters used to calculated the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in [energyexplorer.io](https://energy-explorer.herokuapp.com/site-finder/). More about cost and performance parameters provided by NREL for electricity generating technologies can be found [here](https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2022/index).

[NREL’s Cambium Viewer](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html)
- Database and viewing tool developed by NREL to project future wholesale energy prices and marginal emission rates across the United States. Projections provided by Cambium were are not currently used in [energyexplorer.io](https://energy-explorer.herokuapp.com/site-finder/).
