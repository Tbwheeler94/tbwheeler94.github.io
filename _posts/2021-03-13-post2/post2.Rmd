### Overview

This report provides an exploratory overview of mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) abundance recorded by the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP) from 1995-2002. The original objective of SLIP was to describe impacts of non-native fish on lake communities, but SLIP data has subsequently enabled study of additional ecological issues, including regional amphibian declines and their impacts on communities, and impacts of non-native fish on terrestrial species. In addition, these data are being used to develop fish removal efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems and recover endangered amphibians.

### Data

This data describes the physical characteristics of and surveyed aquatic communities for > 8,000 lentic water bodies in the southern Sierra Nevada, including lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows. The SLIP data is stored in a relational database that collectively describes water bodies (e.g., depth, elevation, location), surveys (conditions, effort), and communities (including approximately 170 fish, amphibian, reptile, benthic macroinvertebrate, and zooplankton taxa).

### Exploratory Findings

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#generate compound figure
(graph_1 / graph_2) & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

**Figure 1:** These figures explore amphibian abundance data recorded by the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project. The top line chart graphs the total mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) count each year across all water bodies, by life stage excluding the ‘EggMass’ level. The column graph contains total counts of combined adult and subadult endangered mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) observed in the 5 lakes with the greatest total observed counts across all years of the study.

### Summary

This exploratory data analysis revealed:

- For most years, counts of mountain yellow-legged frog tadpoles were higher relative to adult and subadult populations across all water bodies
- Lake 50183 exhibited the largest number of observed counts relative to other lakes.
